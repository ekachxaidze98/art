              In the piece Falling (2009), Batiashvili uses a mix of earth
              tones—burnt sienna, indigo, a plethora of greens—to render a
              person being bucked from a horse. In the background six little
              sheep appear, painted with cartoonish regularity. This work
              recalls several pieces by Marc Chagall, who painted imaginative
              scenes with shallow depths of field; both artists have a tendency
              to depict figures with improbably flexible limbs and strange
              proportions in relation to their animal cohorts.
