            The evolution of Georgian national dances began as soon as the
            cities started to celebrate mass holidays in the Middle Ages.
            Military moves, sports games, and dances performed at those
            celebrations were the most popular types of folk art. What Georgians
            have today, though, underwent a long transformation during the
            different epochs.

        <h2 class="national-dance__title">Looking back at the history</h2>
        <p class="national-dance__paragraph">
          Over the centuries, the nation has created more interesting and richer
          dance traditions, choreography, performance techniques, and
          synchronization of music and movement.
        </p>
        <p class="national-dance__paragraph">
          Georgians do not only perform the ancient dances, but also create new
          choreography. All the dances have similar characteristics – women’s
          dances are always distinguished by a sense of synergy, lyricality, and
          grace, while men’s dances show dignity, courage, nobility, and pride.
        </p>
        <p class="national-dance__paragraph">
          The 1940-50s became the new era of Georgian folk choreography, the
          time when well-known ensembles were created. In 1945, Nino Ramishvili
          and Iliko Sukhishvili established the National Ensemble Sukhishvilebi,
          which is still very popular today both in Georgia and abroad.

        <h2 class="national-dance__title">KARTULI</h2>
        <p class="national-dance__paragraph">
          Kartuli, known as Georgian dance in English, is characterized by
          amorous content that represents a chivalric courtship ritual and the
          aesthetic ideals of the nation. The dance clearly shows the majesty of
          a woman, the feeling of freedom, and the pride of the man. It doesn’t
          belong to any particular region, it is a general, nation-wide
          performance.

        <h2 class="national-dance__title">KHORUMI</h2>
        <p class="national-dance__paragraph">
          The roots of Khorumi lie in the ancient state of Georgian culture –
          Diaokh and Colchis. There are several variations of Khorumi that have
          been preserved up to today, with Adjarian, Gurian, and Lazian being
          the most important ones.
        </p>
        <p class="national-dance__paragraph">
          Georgian choreographers have gathered the elements of each and created
          the dance structure of Khorumi that is performed today. The dance has
          four parts: a search for the warrior’s camping place, the reconnoiter
          of the enemy camp, the fight, and the victory and its celebration.
          Traditionally, the dance is performed only by men with an odd number
          of dancers.
        </p>
        <p class="national-dance__paragraph">
          Khorumi is accompanied by the national folk music instruments known as
          doli and tchiboni and has a very different musical rhythm than any of
          the other Georgian dances.
